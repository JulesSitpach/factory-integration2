Absolutely! Here’s a comprehensive documentation package you can include in your GitHub repository to enable Factory AI (or any capable AI development agent) to build your project with minimal ambiguity or risk. This package covers user stories, acceptance criteria, API specs, database schema, migration scripts, CI/CD, legal docs, design resources, and more.

# Factory Integration – Gold-Standard Documentation Package

> **Note:** This documentation is the gold standard for project requirements, architecture, and delivery. For a quickstart, tech stack, and developer onboarding, see the main [README.md](../README.md) at the project root. All contributors and AI agents should reference both documents.

---

## 0. Project Overview

Factory Integration is a modular, event-driven platform that connects ERP, MES, SCADA/IIoT, and other manufacturing systems, delivering real-time data flow, automated workflows, and operational visibility for smart-factory initiatives.

- **Front-End:** Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Back-End:** Next.js App Router API routes, Supabase (Postgres)
- **Auth:** NextAuth.js + OAuth/Email magic-link
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Docker, optional Kubernetes
- **Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest
- **i18n:** English & Spanish (next-i18next)

---

## Core Apps & SMB Value

- **Cost Calculator:**  
  Instantly calculates landed costs and tariffs for uploaded purchase orders.  
  _SMB Benefit:_ Prevents margin loss, enables accurate pricing, and helps SMBs react quickly to tariff changes.

- **Suppliers:**  
  Centralizes supplier data, performance, and risk.  
  _SMB Benefit:_ Reduces supply chain risk, enables fast supplier pivots, and supports compliance.

- **Supply Chain Planner:**  
  Visualizes and optimizes supply chain routes and inventory.  
  _SMB Benefit:_ Minimizes stockouts and overstock, reduces logistics costs, and improves customer satisfaction.

- **Pricing Optimizer:**  
  Models pricing scenarios and suggests optimal prices based on costs and market data.  
  _SMB Benefit:_ Protects margins, increases competitiveness, and automates complex pricing decisions.

- **Tariff Tracker:**  
  Monitors and alerts on tariff changes for relevant products and countries.  
  _SMB Benefit:_ Prevents surprise costs, enables proactive planning, and supports compliance.

- **Route Optimizer:**  
  Finds the most cost-effective and timely shipping routes.  
  _SMB Benefit:_ Reduces shipping costs and delivery times, improving customer experience.

- **Settings & Help:**  
  Easy configuration and in-app support for all users.

## 1. User Stories

**Format:**  
_As a [persona], I want to [do something], so that [I achieve a benefit]._  
(See [Atlassian’s template][4][6])

**Examples:**

- As an SMB owner, I want to upload my purchase orders, so that I can instantly see the tariff and landed cost impact.
- As a supply chain manager, I want to receive AI-driven supplier suggestions, so that I can quickly pivot when tariffs change.
- As a financial analyst, I want to model different pricing scenarios, so that I can protect our margins and communicate with customers.
- As a user, I want to receive alerts before tariff changes, so that I can plan my supply chain in advance.
- As a team member, I want to collaborate and share reports, so that our whole team is aligned.

---

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

**Format:**

- Written in plain language, measurable, testable, and outcome-focused ([Atlassian][5]).

**Example for Emergency Cost Calculator:**

- User can upload CSV, XLSX, or PDF purchase orders.
- The system parses and displays product lines with calculated landed cost and tariff.
- Before/after comparison chart is generated.
- User can export results as PDF or CSV.
- If parsing fails, user receives a clear error message.

(Repeat for each core feature.)

---

## 3. API Specifications

**Format:**

- OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) YAML or JSON ([Swagger][7][8]).

**Example:**

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: TradeNavigatorPro API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /api/cost-calculator:
    post:
      summary: Calculate landed cost and tariffs
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          multipart/form-data:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                file:
                  type: string
                  format: binary
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Calculation results
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  summary:
                    type: string
                  details:
                    type: array
                    items:
                      type: object
                      properties:
                        product_code: { type: string }
                        landed_cost: { type: number }
                        tariff: { type: number }
```

(Repeat for each endpoint: authentication, payments, supply chain, etc.)

---

## 4. Database Schema

**Format:**

- ER diagram (use DrawSQL or EdrawMax for visuals[10][11])
- SQL DDL (schema.sql) for Supabase/Postgres

**Example (simplified):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE organizations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE user_organizations (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  org_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
  role TEXT,
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, org_id)
);

CREATE TABLE purchase_orders (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  org_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
  uploaded_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  file_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE calculations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  po_id UUID REFERENCES purchase_orders(id),
  summary JSONB,
  details JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add tables for subscriptions, payments, alerts, suppliers, etc.
```

---

## 5. Migration Scripts

- Provide initial schema and example migration scripts for updates ([Simple Talk][12]).

**Example:**

```sql
-- Add a column for user language preference
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN preferred_language TEXT DEFAULT 'en';
```

---

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline

- Use GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, or similar ([BMC][13][14], [Supabase Docs][15]).

**Example: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`**

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm run test
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: build-and-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        run: vercel --prod --token ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

---

## 7. Legal & Compliance Documents

- **Privacy Policy:** Use a SaaS-specific template and adapt to your data practices ([TermsFeed][16]).
- **Terms of Service:** Use a SaaS ToS template and adapt to your business ([TermsFeed][17]).
- **Compliance Checklist:** PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC2, etc. ([NordLayer][18]).

---

## 8. Design System & Prototypes

- **Figma Design System:** Use a SaaS-tailored system from Figma Community or Space UI[1][2].
- **Mobile & Web Prototypes:** Use Figma templates for both web and mobile[1][3].
- **Branding:** Document color palette, typography, logo usage (see README style guide above).

---

## 9. Multilanguage/Translation Management

- **Translation Files:**
  - `/locales/en.json`, `/locales/es.json`, etc.
- **Translation Management System:** Use Crowdin, Lokalise, or similar for workflow and translation memory[20].
- **Style Template Translations:** Use XLIFF or similar for style/template translation if needed[19].

---

## 10. Onboarding & User Guidance

- **Interactive onboarding flows:** Documented in Figma and as user stories.
- **In-app help:** FAQs, tooltips, and support widget integration.

---

## 11. Additional Recommendations

- **Feature Flags:** For controlled rollouts and A/B testing.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Sentry, Datadog, or similar.
- **Automated Testing:** Jest, Playwright, or Cypress.
- **API Documentation:** Host Swagger UI or Redoc for live docs.
