As a [persona], I want to [do something], so that [I achieve a benefit].
(See [Atlassianâ€™s template])

Examples:

As an SMB owner, I want to upload my purchase orders, so that I can instantly see the tariff and landed cost impact.

As a supply chain manager, I want to receive AI-driven supplier suggestions, so that I can quickly pivot when tariffs change.

As a financial analyst, I want to model different pricing scenarios, so that I can protect our margins and communicate with customers.

As a user, I want to receive alerts before tariff changes, so that I can plan my supply chain in advance.

As a team member, I want to collaborate and share reports, so that our whole team is aligned.
